Node Webpack Starter
====================

This is my personal configuration for writing nodejs scripts in ES6+ / ESNext, with the latest javascript syntactic sugar.

Things that work out of the box:
  - Babel
  - Webpack 4
  - ESLint

## Getting Started

Clone the module:

    $ git clone github.com/carl-eis/node-webpack-starter

Install Dependencies:

    $ cd node-webpack-starter
    $ yarn start

## Running your scripts

    $ yarn start

## Building for production

    $ yarn build
